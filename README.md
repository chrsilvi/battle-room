This was a text adventure game I made part of the way through the Python
section of the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree. I mostly had a weird
idea of what I thought would be fun and then for practice made myself go
through the entire system.

I had not learned object oriented programming yet when I wrote this, which I
definitely would have used.

For how it works, there are six possible weapons. Three are selected at random
for each play through as options for the player, and the player selects one.

When the player enters the next room, they face one of six potential opponents.
The basic system is that five hits to either the opponent or the player results
in death. Some combinations of weapons and opponents provide an advantage. The
player is given four attack options each round and selects one. It is
intentionally not explained in the game, but any successful hit will not be a
success on the next attack, forcing the player to change their attacks.

There are variations based on the weapon. Some weapons are good against a
specific opponent. The staff uses four different spells, and certain spells
are more effective against certain opponents. The harp behaves as a weapon,
but the text indicates that instead you are trying to play a melody to lull
your enemy to sleep.

If you drink the potion on the other hand, you will have a conversation with
your opponent and pass or fail based on your response.
